# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

OctoAcme uses proven project management practices to deliver product features efficiently and reliably. Our approach is built on key principles that ensure consistent execution and continuous improvement:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to enable rapid feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning across all team members

These processes are documented to support fast onboarding, ensure consistent execution, and provide a single source of truth for new and existing team members.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme's project lifecycle follows a structured approach that emphasizes clarity, collaboration, and continuous improvement:

### Initiation
Validate project need, define success criteria, and align stakeholders. Create a lightweight project one-pager that captures the problem statement, goals, success metrics, and initial timeline to ensure everyone understands the project's purpose before planning begins.

### Planning
Break work into deliverable increments, identify risks and dependencies, and schedule milestones. Establish a prioritized backlog with clear acceptance criteria, define the Definition of Done, and create a release plan that aligns with team capacity and business objectives.

### Execution & Tracking
Use project boards and pull request workflows to maintain delivery cadence. Hold regular standups to surface blockers, track progress with burndown charts and velocity metrics, and ensure quality through automated testing and code reviews. Escalate blockers appropriately to keep work flowing.

### Release & Deployment
Standardize the release process to reduce risk and improve observability. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met, passing CI and security scans, release notes are prepared, and rollback plans are documented before deploying to production.

### Risk Management & Communication
Track and mitigate risks using a risk register that captures impact, likelihood, owners, and mitigation plans. Provide regular stakeholder updates with clear status reports and escalation paths to maintain transparency and alignment.

### Retrospectives & Continuous Improvement
Capture learnings after each sprint, release, or milestone. Identify what went well and what could be improved, then convert insights into actionable improvements with clear owners and timelines. Track action items to ensure continuous process enhancement.

### Roles & Personas
Define key roles and their responsibilities to ensure clarity and accountability:
- **Project Manager**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and communications
- **Product Manager**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and feedback
