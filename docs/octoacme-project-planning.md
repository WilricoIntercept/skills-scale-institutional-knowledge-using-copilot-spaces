# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (including UX Designer, Business Analyst, Technical Writer)
2. Business Analyst facilitates requirements gathering and creates functional specifications
3. UX Designer shares initial wireframes and user research insights
4. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
5. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
6. Define Definition of Done (DoD), including documentation and usability criteria
7. Identify dependencies and integration points
8. Create release plan and milestone map
9. Technical Writer outlines documentation requirements and timeline
